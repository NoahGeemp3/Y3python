#this is a comment
#python ignores comments
#comments are used to explain the code
#the best programmers comment all their code
#the worst programmers dont comment at all
#hashtag is not hashtag it is hash symbol, a baby pidgeon dies every time you say hashtag and not hash symbol

#example
name = "Dave" #this is a variable called name
print (name) #this displays whatever is in name
