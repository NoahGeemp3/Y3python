#DATA TYPES
character = "d"
realFloat = 12.34
integer = 1234
boolean = True
string = "123abcdefg456"
#C.R.I.B.S is a way to remember all the data types

#You can "cast" for data types
#for example:
name = str(input("enter name"))
#in this code str means we want the data entered as a string

age = int(input("enter age"))
#in this code int means we want the data entered as a integer

price = float(input("enter price"))
#in this code float means we want the data entered as a deciaml number

#This is called casting for data types
